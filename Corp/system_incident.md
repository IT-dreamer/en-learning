1. **What is most important is** to minimize impacts on services in case of system incident. **In order to do this**, **prepare** the escalation flow **in advance** assuming any trouble, update of information and manual.

2. You should be focused on returning the performance of the services to normal as quickly as possible. This means the process sometimes prioritize the temporary workarounds, while you identify the root problem of an incident afterwards.

3. If it is not possible to confirm the occurrence of the incident, consider it as an incident and move on to the next phase.

4. You don't need to complete all tasks to handle the incident by yourself alone. Get members involved to fix the incident more immediately.

5. Top priority is to minimize the impact on  services when system incident occurs. Investigate the cause is for the recovery of the incident, not for finding the root cause.

6. Report to the upper manager in case there is no response from your direct manager, or s/he is not available.
